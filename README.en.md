Hook works well for quick capture and light editing.

## Why Hook

Hook focuses on the gap between a screenshot utility and a heavier design tool:

- you can keep editing and organizing after capture
- stickers, annotations, and reference images can stay in the same desktop workspace
- the recycle bin and reference list make assets reusable
- the node canvas and local capability bridges make it more than an image collector

## Core capabilities

- **Capture and long capture**
  - region capture
  - long-capture sessions
  - file-backed capture payloads for desktop performance
- **Sticker and annotation workspace**
  - crop, border, opacity, raster effects, color pick and copy
  - text, numbering, shapes, brush, highlighter
  - recycle bin and reference list
- **Desktop workflow canvas**
  - node graph, links, grouped parameters, sync entry points
  - editing-oriented top toolbar and context menu
  - local startup helpers and single-instance control

## Release packages

- **Portable (Current recommended package)**
  - unzip and run
  - current public release package for quick trials and ordinary daily capture
  - if you hit Windows foreground/elevation limits in scenarios involving
    special windows such as **Task Manager**, try launching Hook as
    **administrator** as the current workaround
- **Installer (Planned for future signed releases)**
  - Hook keeps the signed UIAccess-oriented installer path in development
  - it will become a public release package again after the project has real
    signing material wired into the release pipeline

## Contributing

Issues, build feedback, and focused improvement suggestions are welcome:

- Issues: <https://github.com/aiaimimi0920/Hook/issues>
- Local verification: run `npm run verify:local` (typecheck + frontend build). Packaging is handled by GitHub Actions.
- Public bundle identifier: `com.yamiyu.hook`. Hook keeps compatibility fallbacks for older local data directories created under `io.github.aiaimimi0920.hook` and `com.vmjcv.hook`.
