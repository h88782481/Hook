/**
 * Shared plumbing for the live (drag-to-erase) pipelines.
 *
 * Both the "erase annotations only" and "erase image content" flows need the
 * same concurrency machinery: a monotonic generation token so a new stroke
 * supersedes an in-flight one, a pending-points buffer that coalesces pointer
 * moves arriving faster than the async erase can process them, a single-runner
 * guard, and a promise the pointer-up handler can await. This class owns exactly
 * that plumbing so the two call sites no longer duplicate (and drift on) the
 * tricky race handling; the layer-specific erase + patch work stays in a
 * `process` callback supplied by the caller.
 *
 * The callback receives the generation it was started under and should re-check
 * `isCurrent(generation)` after every `await` before applying a result, exactly
 * as the inline queues did, so results from a superseded/finished stroke are
 * dropped instead of clobbering newer state.
